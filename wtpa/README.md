## Description

Where the Party At is an event management system. The idea came when I found myself juggling to RSVP, keep track of the date, location, buying presents, etc. to so many event invites for my friends and family. 

Where the Party At allows users - party hosts or guests - to create events, manage event details such as date, time, location, and guests. 
With the RSVP list, the host can keep track of the guests that have RSVP'd with details on how many extra people they are bringing.
