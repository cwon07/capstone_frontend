## Description

Where the Party At is an event management system. The idea came when I found myself juggling to RSVP, keep track of the date, location, buying presents, etc. to so many event invites for my friends and family. 

Where the Party At allows users - party hosts or guests - to create events, manage event details such as date, time, location, and guests on the Events tab.

With the RSVP list, the host can keep track of the guests that have RSVP'd with details on how many extra people they are bringing. 

## Tech Stack

Angular, Typescript, Bootstrap, Firebase for database, authentication, and hosting

## Additional Features to Add

In the near future I'd like to add the Google Map API to show where the event venue is going to be when user enters in the address. User can also add guests' email address and sent out an RSVP email, where guests can RSVP and the app compiles a confirmed RSVP list for the host. Lastly, make the app look nicer by adding some animation and more styling.

## Roadmap

Angular + Typescript, 
Utilize Firebase for database, authentication, and hosting
